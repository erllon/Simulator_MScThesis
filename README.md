<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This simulator was developed as part of my master thesis within Cybernetics and Robotics at Norwegian University of Sceince and Technology (NTNU). The goal of the thesis was to investigate how micro indoor drones could be deployed incrementally into a GNSS denied disaster area to aid the localization of first responders.
